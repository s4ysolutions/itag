In case of emergency when the iTag with the keys or wallet attached to it happens to be out of range of 15m(50ft) the Android phone will start buzzle and the image of the itag visually vibrate. This annoying sound can be cancelled in the moment by the single click on the pop up message, device image or even on the real device's button (in case you can grab it faster than a phone). It is possible to shut up the phone with the brown `bell` button for some period of time - for exmaple if you intentionly left the chained thing.

No less use than anti-lost alarm is a `search feature`. It often happens one knows the wallet is somewhere near by but can not remember where it is namely. No annoying anymore. Just click the iTag image and the real iTag device will start buzz - letting no a human do not event start to become nervious. Needless to say it works vice-versa: double clicking on real iTag device makes the phone to ring cleary pointing out where it is. From our experience having a phone with installed iTag One and at least 2 iTag devices turns the life to be much more happy than it used to be before. 

One may wonder why it is necessary to double click the device in order to search the smartphone. The answer is simple - we tested the application a lot in real life and noticed there are lot of accident device button clicks causing  annoying loud signal.
